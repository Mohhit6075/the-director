# TODO: Redesign Product Page with Modern UI/UX

## Tasks
- [x] Add price field to all products in `src/data/products.js`
- [x] Redesign `src/pages/ProductPage.jsx` with modern layout:

  - Size selection dropdown
  - Quantity selector
  - Add to cart button with integration
  - Specifications section
  - Responsive design using Tailwind CSS

- Prices: Assign realistic prices (e.g., suits $200-500, t-shirts $20-50, accessories $30-100)
- Ensure cart integration works (use AuthContext for addToCart)
- Use existing UI components (Button, Input)
- Make it professional and user-friendly
